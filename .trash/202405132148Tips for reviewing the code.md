# Tips for reviewing the code
### Tip 1: Leave clear comments
The important part of code review is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">an explicit communication between reciever and sender</mark>. Comments may not only be critical by pointing to coder mistakes. They allow to show different feedback based on a situation. You may leave a comment to:
- Point to mistakes and bottle neks
- Suggest changes and personal views. The reviewer can ask for cahnges and also allow to make a decition by developer.
- Ask questions to clarify some parts of code
### Tip 2: Set a list of rules when to approve/disapprove the MR
==The person who sends an MR should be aware of reasons why their code was not approved by a reviewer.== In other way it’s just a subjective POV withour any basic requirements to code.
### Tip 3: decide when to leave comments and when to have a live conversation
There might be situation when i.e. the whole written code should be rewritten. In this case it’s better not to wrtite the paragraphs of comments and play a ping-pong chatting in threads with developer but to meet a developer offline and discuss things together.
